                    'artificial intelligence': "Artificial Intelligence is a fascinating field! It's essentially computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence - like learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and understanding language. AI powers everything from virtual assistants to recommendation systems. There are different types: narrow AI (like what I am), which excels at specific tasks, and the theoretical general AI. What specifically about AI interests you?",
                    
                    'machine learning': "Machine Learning is a subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed for every scenario. Think of it like teaching a computer to recognize cats by showing it thousands of cat photos, rather than programming every possible cat feature. It's behind many technologies we use daily - from email spam detection to Netflix recommendations!",
                    
                    'technology trends': "Some exciting current tech trends include: AI integration across industries, quantum computing breakthroughs, sustainable tech solutions, Web3 and decentralized systems, AR/VR becoming mainstream, edge computing, and biotechnology advances. The pace of innovation is incredible! Which area would you like to explore further?",
                    
                    'productivity': "Great question! Here are some proven productivity strategies: 1) Time blocking - dedicate specific time slots to tasks, 2) The 2-minute rule - if something takes under 2 minutes, do it now, 3) Focus on high-impact activities first, 4) Take regular breaks (Pomodoro technique works well), 5) Minimize distractions and notifications. What specific productivity challenges are you facing?",
                    
                    'creativity': "Creativity is such a wonderful human capacity! Some ways to boost creativity: expose yourself to diverse experiences, practice brainstorming without judgment, take breaks to let your mind wander, collaborate with others, ask 'what if' questions, and don't fear failure. Creative blocks are normal - sometimes stepping away and returning with fresh eyes helps. What creative project are you working on?",
                    
                    'science': "Science is amazing - it's our way of understanding the world through observation, experimentation, and evidence. From the tiniest quantum particles to vast galaxies, from DNA to ecosystems, science reveals incredible patterns and connections. Is there a particular scientific field or discovery you're curious about?",
                    
                    'learning': "Learning is a lifelong adventure! Effective strategies include: active recall (testing yourself), spaced repetition, connecting new info to what you already know, teaching others, and mixing different topics. Everyone learns differently - some are visual, others prefer hands-on experience. What are you trying to learn?"
